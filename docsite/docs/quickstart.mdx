## Prerequisites

* You have Komodo already setup
* You have installed [Periphery](https://komo.do/docs/connect-servers) on a machine
  * The Komodo [Server](https://komo.do/docs/resources#server) name is `my-cool-server`

## Create Your Scenario

**Follow the directions below, select your options, and fill in all fields to generate a customized Docker Compose file for your specific scenario.**

<QuickstartCompose/>

## Generate Stacks

Run the customized `compose.yaml` from above with `docker compose` to generate Komodo Stacks from existing projects on your machine!

```bash
# in the same directory as compose.yaml...
docker compose up --no-log-prefix
```

How the Stacks will be generated is determined by what you chose in **Step 4**. Refer to the expandable **Examples** in that step.

## Next Steps

There are many more options (environmental variables) that can be used to customize how Stacks are generated, all found in [Usage](../usage/overview#stacks) docs. Some customizations that might interest you:

* [Common Stack options](../usage/overview#common-stack-configuration)
  * Set image registry provider/account
  * Set defaults for polling for new images (`POLL_FOR_UPDATE`) and auto updating (`AUTO_UPDATE`)
  * Set what compose files (`COMPOSE_FILE_GLOB`) and .env files (`ENV_FILE_GLOB`) to include, per Stack
* For **Directory** generated stacks...
  * Include (`FOLDER_GLOB`) or exclude (`FOLDER_IGNORE_GLOB`) folders based on patterns
* Configure Komodo Import to use the Komodo API for better integration
  * Uses existing Linked Repos for Git Based Stacks
  * Automatically configures Git Based Stacks to use existing, private Git Provider if git URL domains match

Additionally, review the [Sync Resource](../usage/resourceSync) guide to learn how to use them for creating Stacks in Komodo.
